### I always, always forget this quick time-saver:

[This StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25014240/r-automatically-print-value-after-assignment) reminds me that placing an R command assigning an expression/variable in quotes will force automatic printing upon execution as follows:

    n<-3
    n  
    ##[1] 3

    # versus

    (n <- 3)
    ##[1] 3
