### *Black Box Thinking* author Matthew Syed interview

The podcast "Philosophy Bites" has been a favorite for some time, with hundreds of backlogged interviews with working philosophers that take you through their area of expertise. This new interview podcast by Nigel Warburton, Thinking Books, covers "authors of interesting books about thinking." [The first episode where Nigel interviews Matthew Syed](http://nigelwarburton.typepad.com/thinking_books/2017/07/matthew-syed-on-black-box-thinking.html) is not to be missed.
