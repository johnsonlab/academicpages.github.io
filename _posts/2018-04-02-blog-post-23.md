# Electronic Lab Notebooks Using Rstudio

UC-Denver bioinformaticist [Wladimir Labeikovsky](http://hslibraryguides.ucdenver.edu/prf.php?account_id=134943) invited me to present at his Reproducible Research / Data Science lecture series some time ago, so I decided to share my method for keeping track of laboratory projects in an "electronic lab notebook." The presentation was well-received last Friday March 30, so I thought I'd summarize in a blog post here. I can't overemphasize how effective this approach has been for me personally, and how valuable I think it can be for trainees moving forward.

## The Electronic Lab Notebook as "The Narrative"



## The Example Output
