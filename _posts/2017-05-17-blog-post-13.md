### UC-Denver DRS Journal Club 051917 *SPECIAL MENTION*

Michael Oliphant presented ["An extra-uterine system to physiologically support the extreme premature lamb"](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15112) By Partridge and colleagues. A fantastically interesting paper and with strong MFM expertise in the room (both clinical and basic), we learned a lot about the implications of this early-stages intervention.

*Highly recommended*
