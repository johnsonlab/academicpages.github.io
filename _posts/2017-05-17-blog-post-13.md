### UC-Denver DRS Journal Club 051917 *SPECIAL MENTION*

Michael Oliphant presented "An extra-uterine system to physiologically support the extreme premature lamb" By Partridge and colleagues. A fantastically interesting paper and with strong MFM expertise in the room (both clinical and basic), we learned a lot about the implications of this early-stages intervention.
