Visiting Speaker [Tobin Magle](http://libguides.colostate.edu/prf.php?account_id=108354) provided a super lecture introducing attendees to reproducible research concepts and workflow. Materials and links were provided helping people get started. If interested in access to RRC materials (*via* invitation to the Club GitHub repository), including RStudio templates, email Josh at joshua.2.johnson@ucdenver.edu. We'll hold RRC biweekly, offering statistics and data management "clinic time" at each meeting.
