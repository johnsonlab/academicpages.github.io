### Dr. Edward Gabriele on the passing of Ruth Pope (thanks Amanda J. Peng, UC-D)

 
"After all, research really is not just all about the business of funded grants and contracts. It is not just about compliance with regulations or the reporting of metrics of productivity. Research is about something much deeper. Ultimately, it is about the nurturing of genius so that it becomes the innovation needed for the good of others, and for our world to take the most needed quantum leap into the fullness that is justice and human rights.”
