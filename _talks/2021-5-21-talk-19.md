This lecture for a fertility preservation provider audience provided a backdrop of basic and translational ovarian biology. In it, we asked the question: when we cryopreserve patient ovarian cortex, what is it that needs to "go right" so ovarian function recovers? So that the patient has the highest chances for ongoing ovarian function and potential conception? Special consideration was given to potentially compromised ovarian function due to the underlying cancer.
