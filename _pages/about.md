## [UC-Denver Website](http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/obgyn/Divisions/reprosciences/faculty/Pages/Johnson-Josh,-PhD.aspx)
=======
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Our research focuses on the control of oocyte (egg) number inside the ovary, primarily in mammals, but also in the fruit fly model organism. We are currently focused on mechanisms that support oocyte quality--the ability to give rise to a healthy offspring--and those that lead to oocyte loss. Oocyte loss occurs due to 'normal' aging, and can be accelerated in the context of human premature ovarian failure (POF). Many critical measures of health and well-being are compromised when ovaries fail. Our primary mission is thus to better understand mechanisms that control oocyte number so we can better support women's health.

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
