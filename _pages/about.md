Dr. Johnson's research program focuses on the control of oocyte number inside the ovary, primarily in mammals, but also in the fruit fly model organism. We are currently focused on mechanisms that support oocyte quality--the ability to give rise to a healthy offspring--and those that lead to oocyte loss, due to 'normal' aging and in the context of human premature ovarian failure (POF). To maximize his clinical/translational acumen, Dr. Johnson was trained and worked part-time as an embryologist in the Yale IVF Center. Now, our primary mission is to better understand the function of the ovary so we can first identify women whose ovaries are at risk of failing or who will have trouble conceiving, and one day intervene to protect fertility and organ function.
