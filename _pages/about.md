Our research focuses on the control of oocyte (egg) number inside the ovary, primarily in mammals, but also in the fruit fly model organism. We are currently focused on mechanisms that support oocyte quality--the ability to give rise to a healthy offspring--and those that lead to oocyte loss. Oocyte loss occurs due to 'normal' aging, and can be accelerated in the context of human premature ovarian failure (POF). Many critical measures of health and well-being are compromised when ovaries fail. Our primary mission is thus to better understand mechanisms that control oocyte number so we can better support women's health.
